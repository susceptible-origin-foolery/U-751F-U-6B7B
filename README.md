## Rules

* rules are hard
* rules are something else
* rules are like those lyrics from that Tonic? song about you want it more, more than I can give
* rules are a way to say, let's stop there and choose a different course

### A Rule
A fun rejoinder: "I don't know what sentiment you are putting forth.  Could you explain further?"

### B Rule
 * cats have paws
